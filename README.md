The Bg3LST (Bg3 Long Sleep Tool) is a simple Python Terminal script that can be edited with custom options. The tool is useful after long sleep to ensure you've used all of your post-sleep "until long rest" buffs. 
The script can be ran via any typical Python supported terminal on any Python supported OS.

To customize the BG3LST to your specific needs, simply open the BG3LST.py file and edit the "options = A. Longstrider..." Replace the names of the spells with your own. Should you need to add additional spells, simply continue with "E. Spell, F. Spell, etc, etc," Save the file and run as usual.
