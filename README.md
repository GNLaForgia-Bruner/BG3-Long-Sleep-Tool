The Bg3LST (Bg3 Long Sleep Tool) is a simple Python Terminal script that can be edited with custom options. The tool is useful after long sleep to ensure you've used all of your post-sleep "until long rest" buffs. 
The script can be ran via any typical Python supported terminal on any Python supported OS.
